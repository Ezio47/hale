# How to contribute

Third-party contributions are essential to grow and expand the functionality of HALE.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get your use cases working.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork and clone the repository on GitHub
* [Set up your local development environment](https://github.com/halestudio/hale/wiki/Set-up-your-development-environment)

## Making Changes

* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the **master** branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    feature/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    **master** branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure you use meaningful and properly formatted commit messages.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://wetransform.box.com/v/hale-cla).
* Push your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the **halestudio** organization.
* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis and provides feedback.
* If your pull request passes code reviews and automated tests it will eventually get merged.
