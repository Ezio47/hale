 * such that a first stage of refactoring has been done to the structure of the
 * data within the schema mapping. Nevertheless, the structure of the model at
 * this stage is close to that of the original
 * {@link eu.esdihumboldt.goml.align.Alignment}. The basic unit of mapping is
 * still on the level of the cell.
