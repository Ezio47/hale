/**
 * Provides classes that model an interim state of the translation when it has
 * progressed one stage on from an {@link eu.esdihumboldt.goml.align.Alignment},
 * such that a first stage of refactoring has been done to the structure of the
 * data within the schema mapping. Nevertheless, the structure of the model at
 * this stage is close to that of the original
 * {@link eu.esdihumboldt.goml.align.Alignment}. The basic unit of mapping is
 * still on the level of the cell.
