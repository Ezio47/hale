NamespacePrefixMapper for HALE

The JRE provides JAXB, which is exported by the system bundle. Because the HALE 
plugin already has a dependency to the system bundle (OSGi framework) it can't
use the JAXB provided by the target platform.
This poses a problem when using the NamespacePrefixMapper from the Humboldt
Common Library, which references a class that is only present in the target
platform's JAXB implementation (com.sun.xml.bind.marshaller.NamespacePrefixMapper).
Using this class results in a conflict, so the corresponding class in the JRE
must be used (com.sun.xml.internal.bind.marshaller.NamespacePrefixMapper).
Because access to this class is restricted, this Eclipse project has to be
a normal Java project instead of a PDE project.
Because there may still be issues compiling this project in Eclipse, this bundle
is also provided pre-compiled in the target platform. Therefore it need not be
imported into the workspace.
